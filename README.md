# Liquor_Store_CaseStudy
A small case study, where I used Python to analyze liquor store sales data, in order to extract some useful insights.

### Project Overview

This project is an assignment, that is included in the Machine Learning and AI Bootcamp by Workearly. During this assignment, we were tasked to analyze a data set that contained liquor stores' sales data, using Python. The objective of our analysis was to extract useful insights regarding the top-selling areas and the top-selling stores for a specific time period. Most accurately, the tasks at hand were the following: 

For the timeframe 2016-2019:
1. Discern the most popular item in each zip code 
2. Compute the sales percentage per store (in dollars).

### Data Sources

Liquor sales data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "finance_liquor_sales.csv", containing detailed information about each sale.  This data set is provided by the Workearly's Machine Learning and AI Bootcamp.

### Tools

The whole analysis was executed using Python and an array of relevant Python Libraries, such as:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Plotly
